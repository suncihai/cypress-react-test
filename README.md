## Example of using [cypress-react-selector](https://github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/cypress-react-selector) with [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/)

The goal of this project is to give an example of how to use `cy.react()` with a non-trivial but commonly used set of React components.

### Run this example
1. `git clone https://github.com/gregfenton/example-cypress-react-selector-formik.git`
1. `cd example-cypress-react-selector-formik`
1. `npm install`
1. In one console, run: `npm start`
1. In another console, run:  `$(npm bin)/cypress open`
1. When the Cypress window opens, click to run the test __form_spec.js__

### Understanding this example
There are two files in this example worth understanding:
1. `src/App.js` contains the form displayed in the UI.  This is essentially the entire application, with the rest of the files in `src` and `public` having been generated by CRA.
1. `cypress/integration/form_spec.js` is the one test spec that uses [cypress-react-selector](https://github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/cypress-react-selector) to interact with React elements (Formik fields) and validates the result of submitting the form.

### Dependencies
See `package.json` at the root of this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
